## **Brief information about me:**

In school, I fell in love with computer science and even back then, I thought that programming was exactly what I needed. I dreamed that one day I would create my first game that millions of people would play. Once, I took a free course in Python, which I honestly completely forgot. But soon after, I had the chance to enroll in School 21, where I fully realized what programming really entails. I tried programming in C, dabbled in system administration, but with each project, I felt more and more discouraged, thinking that programming wasn't for me. Then some friends suggested I try web development. And that's when I realized it was exactly what I needed. I've always liked design, so Frontend development is the best option for me.

Now, I dedicate all my free time to learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and my goal is to become a skilled Frontend developer.
