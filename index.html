                        <h1>About Me</h1>
                        <p>In school, I fell in love with computer science and even back then, I thought that
                            programming was
                            exactly what I needed. I dreamed that one day I would create my first game that millions of
                            people
                            would play. Once, I took a free course in Python, which I honestly completely forgot. But
                            soon
                            after, I had the chance to enroll in School 21, where I fully realized what programming
                            really
                            entails.
                            <!-- I tried programming in C, dabbled in system administration, but with each project,
                            I felt
                            more and more discouraged, thinking that programming wasn’t for me. Then some friends
                            suggested I
                            try web development. And that’s when I realized it was exactly what I needed. I’ve always
                            liked
                            design, so Frontend development is the best option for me.

                            Now, I dedicate all my free time to learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and my goal is to
                            become a
                            skilled Frontend developer.</p> -->
